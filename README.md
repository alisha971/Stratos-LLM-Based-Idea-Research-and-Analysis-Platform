# 💡 Stratos — LLM-Based Idea Research & Analysis Platform

Stratos is an **agentic AI platform** designed to help users turn **vague ideas into clear, validated, and actionable product insights**.

It bridges the gap between **brainstorming** and **real execution** by guiding users through structured thinking, research, and market validation — something general-purpose AI tools don’t do well.

## 🧠 The Problem

People with new ideas often struggle to move from:

> *“I have an idea”*
> → *“I know exactly what problem this solves, for whom, why it matters, and how to proceed.”*

### Why this happens:

* Ideas start vague and unstructured
* Most people don’t think like product builders
* Research is fragmented, time-consuming, and inconsistent
* Tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity give **answers**, not **guided thinking**

There’s a clear gap between **imagination and execution**.

## 💡 What Stratos Solves

Stratos helps users convert:

* **Raw ideas → structured concepts**
* **Vague thoughts → validated insights**
* **Inspiration → grounded product direction**

It guides users step-by-step to define:

* The real problem
* Target persona
* Market context
* Competitor landscape
* Feasibility & differentiation
* Clear next steps

All in one guided, research-backed flow.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

* Early-stage founders
* Students & researchers
* Indie builders
* Product managers
* Designers & analysts

Anyone who wants to **explore, validate, and refine ideas** but lacks structured frameworks or deep research skills.

## 🧩 What Makes Stratos Different?

Unlike existing tools:

* **ChatGPT / Gemini / Perplexity**
  → General-purpose, shallow, no guided reasoning

* **Anara**
  → Research-paper comparison focused

* **Klue / Crayon**
  → Heavy on financial and competitor intelligence

**Stratos sits in between**:

* Brainstorming tools
* Research assistants
* Market intelligence platforms
* Product strategy & design thinking frameworks

It doesn’t just respond — **it guides**.
